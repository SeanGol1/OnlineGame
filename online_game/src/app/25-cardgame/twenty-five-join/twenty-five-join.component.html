    <h3>2. Setup & Trump</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Each player antes into the pot.</li>
      <li>Deal 5 cards to each player (usually in packets of 3–2).</li>
      <li>One extra card is dealt face-up to determine the trump suit.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

    <h3>3. Trump Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>In the trump suit, the ranking is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Five of trumps</strong> (highest)</li>
      <li><strong>Jack of trumps</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Ace of Hearts</strong> (always ranks above other Aces)</li>
      <li><strong>Ace of trumps</strong> (if Hearts is not trump)</li>
      <li>Remaining trump cards in standard order (K &gt; Q &gt; J &gt; 10 ...)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: In red suits, Ace is high. In black suits, Ace is low.</p>

    <h3>4. Gameplay</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The player to the dealer's left leads the first trick.</li>
      <li>Players must follow suit if they can.</li>
      <li>If unable to follow suit, a player may play a trump card to try and win the trick.</li>
      <li>The highest trump wins the trick. If no trumps are played, highest card of the suit led wins.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
    <h3>5. Reneging Rules</h3>
    <p>Some special trump cards—Five of trumps, Jack of trumps, and Ace of Hearts—may be held back even if you can follow suit. These are the only cards allowed to <strong>renege</strong>.</p>
    <p>If a red five is led, these cards <em>must</em> be played if possible.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
    <h3>6. Scoring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Win at least 3 tricks to claim the pot.</li>
      <li>If no player wins 3 tricks, the round is spoiled and the pot carries over.</li>
      <li>Winning all 5 tricks is called a <strong>jink</strong> and may result in a bonus (if playing for stakes).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4">
    <h3>7. Strategy Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Save powerful trump cards (especially the Five) for critical moments.</li>
      <li>Track what suits have been played to guess opponent hands.</li>
      <li>Don't waste trumps on low-value tricks unless necessary.</li>
    </ul>
